{htxt id='id-link-target-enabled'}
  <p>{ts}Here you can enable the use of an external registration-page.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}If this box is not checked but a Url has been provided, then the Url will be ignored and the built-in registration-page will be used.{/ts}</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id='id-link-target'}
  <p>{ts}Here you can add a Url, in order to use an external registration-page, rather than the built-in one.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}The provided Url <strong>has to</strong> contain the <code>&#123;token&#125;</code> which will be replaced by the generated code.{/ts}</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id='id-token-timeout'}
  <p>{ts}Here you can define, until when the token should be valid.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}After the event has ended, none of the tokens will be valid any more, regardless of this setting.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}Keep in mind that this is encoded in the token itself, so changing this setting will only affect newly generated tokens.{/ts}</p>
